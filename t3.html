The Kamagaya Daibutsu was commissioned by a wealthy local merchant, Okuniya Fukuda Bunemon,
 to pray for the souls of his ancestors. It was cast by Tagawa Shuzen, a noted foundry smith of Kanda in Edo and 
It was completed in November 1776. It became the symbol of Kamagaya, and was protected by local residents against 
the movement to eradicate Buddhism of the early Meiji period, and against efforts by the government to collect 
all available bronze for the war effort in World War II. It was designated as a cultural property of 
Kamagaya City in 1972. The statue remains property of the Fukuda family.
